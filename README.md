Interactive - This Python code creates a dynamic chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It takes the user's API key, initializes a list to store chat messages, and prompts the user to specify the chatbot type. The chatbot starts the conversation and keeps responding to the user until they type "quit()". The 'openai.ChatCompletion.create()' method is used to interact with the API and get AI-generated responses for the user's input.
